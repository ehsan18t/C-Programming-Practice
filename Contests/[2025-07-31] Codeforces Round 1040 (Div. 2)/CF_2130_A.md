This problem asks for the maximum score obtainable by partitioning a multiset `S` into subsets and, for each subset, choosing to add either its `sum` or its `mex` (Minimum Excluded/smallest missing number) to the total score.

### 1. Deconstructing the Problem

First, let's understand the core mechanics and constraints.

*   **Goal**: Maximize the total score.
*   **Operations**: We can partition the initial multiset `S` into any number of disjoint subsets. For each subset `S'`, we choose one of two scoring methods:
    1.  `sum(S')`: The sum of its elements.
    2.  `mex(S')`: The smallest non-negative integer not in `S'`.
*   **Key Insight**: The problem isn't about a sequence of operations, but about finding the single best *partition* of the multiset `S`. The total score is the sum of scores from each subset in the optimal partition.
*   **Constraints**: `n <= 50` and `0 <= S_i <= 50`. These small constraints are a strong hint that a dynamic programming (DP) solution with a state dependent on `n` and the element values is feasible.

### 2. Analyzing the `sum` vs. `mex` Trade-off

The central challenge is deciding whether to use an element to contribute to a `sum` or to help form a valuable `mex`.

*   **The `sum` operation is simple**: If an element `x` is in a subset `S'` that is scored by `sum`, it contributes exactly `x` to the total score.
*   **The `mex` operation is structural**: To achieve a `mex` of `k`, a subset `S'` *must* contain at least one instance of `0, 1, ..., k-1` and *must not* contain any instance of `k`. The elements `0, 1, ..., k-1` are "sacrificed" â€” their own values don't contribute to the score, but they enable the `mex(S') = k` score.

This creates a clear trade-off: do we use the number `i` to get a score of `i` (via `sum`), or do we use it to help build a subset that will hopefully score a `mex` greater than `i`?

### 3. Developing a Dynamic Programming Approach

The small value range of elements (`0` to `50`) suggests a DP approach that processes numbers one by one. Let's build our solution by making decisions for each number `i` from `0` to `50`.

First, we pre-process the input into a frequency array, `count[i]`, which stores how many times the number `i` appears in the input multiset `S`.

#### DP State

We need to carry information from one step to the next. When we are deciding what to do with the number `i`, the crucial information we need from our decisions on numbers `< i` is: "How many subsets are we currently building with the hope of achieving a high `mex`?"

Let's call a subset that contains `0, 1, ..., i-1` an **"active mex-group"**. It's "active" because we can add an `i` to it to continue its streak, aiming for an even higher `mex`.

This leads to our DP state, stored in a 2D vector `v`:
`v[i][j]` = The maximum possible score considering only the numbers `0, 1, ..., i-1`, given that we have formed `j` active mex-groups.

#### DP Transition

Now, let's formulate the transition. Suppose we have calculated all `v[i][j]` values and we are now considering the number `i`, for which we have `count[i]` occurrences.

For a given state `v[i][j]`, we have `j` active mex-groups and `count[i]` copies of the number `i`. We need to decide how to use them. Let's say we choose to continue building `k` of our `j` active groups.

*   `0 <= k <= j` (We can't continue more groups than we have).
*   `k <= count[i]` (We need at least one `i` for each group we continue).

Let's analyze the consequences of this choice:

1.  **Continuing `k` groups**: We take `k` of our `i`'s and add one to each of the `k` chosen active groups. These `k` groups now contain `0, 1, ..., i` and become the "active mex-groups" for the next stage, `i+1`. This sets up the state `v[i+1][k]`.

2.  **Finalizing `j-k` groups**: The remaining `j-k` active groups are not given an `i`. Their `mex` is exactly `i`. This contributes `(j-k) * i` to the score.

3.  **Using the leftover `i`'s**: We used `k` of our `i`'s, leaving `count[i] - k`. Their best use is to contribute to a `sum`. This adds `(count[i] - k) * i` to the score.

In the code, the current score (`cs`) is `v[i][j]` and the added score (`as`) combines the gains from finalizing groups and using leftovers for sum:
`as = (j-k)*i + (count[i]-k)*i`

The transition formula is:
`v[i+1][k] = max(v[i+1][k], cs + as)`

We iterate through all possible `j` and `k` to find the maximum value for `v[i+1][k]`.

#### Base Case

The DP starts before processing the number `0`. The number `0` is special; it's the start of any mex-group. We have `count[0]` zeros. The best strategy is to use each `0` to start a new potential mex-group.

So, our base case is at `i=0` (representing the state *before* processing number `0`):
*   `v[0][count[0]] = 0`
*   All other `v[0][j]` are `-LLINF` to signify they are unreachable states.

#### Final Answer

After we have iterated through all numbers up to `i=50`, our DP table `v[51]` will be filled. A state `v[51][k]` means we have achieved a certain score and are left with `k` groups that contain all numbers from `0` to `50`.

The `mex` of these `k` groups is `51`. We can cash them in for a final score of `k * 51`.

The total maximum score (`ms`) is the maximum of `v[51][k] + k * 51` over all possible final group counts `k`.

### 4. Summary of the Algorithm

1.  Read `n` and the multiset `S`. Create a frequency array `count[51]`.
2.  Initialize a 2D DP vector, `v[52][n+1]`, with `-LLINF` to represent unreachability.
3.  Set the base case: `v[0][count[0]] = 0`.
4.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `50` (representing the number being processed):
    *   Iterate `j` from `0` to `n` (number of active mex-groups from the previous step):
        *   If `v[i][j]` is unreachable, continue.
        *   Iterate `k` from `0` to `j` (number of groups to continue to the next step):
            *   If `k > count[i]`, break.
            *   Let `cs = v[i][j]`.
            *   Calculate the added score: `as = (long long)(j - k) * i + (long long)(count[i] - k) * i`.
            *   Update the next state: `v[i+1][k] = max(v[i+1][k], cs + as)`.
5.  Calculate the final answer. Initialize `ms = 0`.
6.  Iterate `k` from `0` to `n`:
    *   If `v[51][k]` is reachable, update `ms = max(ms, v[51][k] + (long long)k * 51)`.
7.  Print `ms`.
